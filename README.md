# Detect the RGB Color from Webcam using Python OpenCV

This simple Python script captures video from your webcam in real-time and determines the dominant color (Blue, Green, or Red) of each frame. It uses the OpenCV library to access the webcam and process the frames.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3
- OpenCV library (`cv2`)

### Installation

Clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SnookyDru/Detect-the-RGB-color-from-a-webcam-using-Python-OpenCV.git
```

Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy
```

## How it Works

The script captures frames from the webcam and calculates the mean values of the Blue, Green, and Red color channels for each frame. It then determines the dominant color by comparing these mean values.
